# Sparkify - Pyspark Data analysis

https://medium.com/@misraketshai/sparkify-an-example-of-data-analysis-using-pyspark-834053bd89a3?postPublishedType=initial

This is the capstone project for the Data Scientist Nanodegree program at Udacity. The goal of this project is to apply knowledge of Spark, create a product that can be deployed with cloud services, and use many of the skills that I've developed throughout the Nanodegree. 

The dataset provided for this project is from Sparkify, a fictional music streaming app. The data (which is a subset of a larger one) shows the usage of the appâ€™s subscribers for approximately three months. The goal was to discover the high risk group of customers who were likely to churn.

The results of this analysis is a list of users that can be further experimented and examined to find ways to retain their subscription. The models f1 score came to be around 65% for the chosen Logisitic Regression, with a precision of 70%. The list of at risk users was taken from the false positives.
